  Welcome to Prawn, the best pure-Ruby PDF solution ever!
  This is version 0.8
   
  For those coming from Prawn 0.7 or earlier, note that this release has
  some API breaking changes as well as many new features.  *** You'll want 
  to know about these changes, as we will no longer be supporting
  Prawn 0.7 or any earlier version of Prawn***

  For details on what has changed, see:
    http://wiki.github.com/sandal/prawn/changelog

  Prawn is meant for experienced Ruby hackers, so if you are new to Ruby, you
  might want to wait until you've had some practice with the language before
  expecting Prawn to work for you.  Things may change after 1.0, but for now
  if you're not ready to read source code and patch bugs or missing features 
  yourself (with our help), Prawn might not be the right fit.

  But if you know what you're getting yourself into, enjoy!
